# IDEA: To use techology to alert people so they can avoid from disaster. 
1. Crowdsource map points with forms and send push notification alerts if the point is marked not safe.
Collaborate in real-time with people and community to add map points and share data, creating a powerful global network of contributors. 
Create custom form builder with logic to collect inputs and instantly map them.

2. Use images to alert. Example from surveilance cameras or allow people to use images to check for hazards. An example using AI to identify rip currents from images https://niwa.co.nz/hazards/identifying-rip-currents-using-artificial-intelligence

3. Use existing Data from various sources to Alert hazzard.
For example using data from open street map https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap.
Usecase using openmap https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps
Organic Maps is a free Android & iOS offline maps app for travelers, tourists, hikers, and cyclists. It uses crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap data.

4. Credit people when someone found it helpful or even allow people to send gifts/vouchers when the marking really saved their life.

There are some great libraries we can use to achieve our project result. Many opensource projects and AI libraries that we can bring together to create an impact!

For Example, We could use
Using Map Libraries (https://maplibre.org/about/). Just need to convert data into GeoJSON format, generate tiles with tippecanoe (https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe) and configure the browsing experience.
